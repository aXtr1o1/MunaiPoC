Title : Iruvachi
Author : Muruga Prakash Ganesan
Genre : Drama
Logline : In Theni during the early 1960s, Kalishwari Sethupathi loses both her father and lover
to a deadly political game
Main Characters : Kaali , Periyavar , Karuppu , Paraman .
What works : The script works well with its rooted setup in Theni backdrop, blending the caste
angle naturally into the story. The rebellious young woman at its heart breaks societal norms
and boldly voices her thoughts, adding a uniqueness to the narrative. The idea to use the red
screen works.
What can be better : The screenplay needs a lot of reworking to strengthen its impact. The plot
takes too long to unfold, making it unclear where the story is headed at times. While the
protagonist's rebellious nature is evident, it lacks the emotional depth needed for the audience
to truly feel and empathize with her, making it difficult to stay invested in her journey. Sometimes
we even feel irritated with her.
Most characters feel one-dimensional, and both the father-daughter dynamic and the love story
between Kaali and Karuppu lack depth, making the narrative feel weak and unengaging.
Periyavar’s sudden shift in believing the lies and acting upon feels forced and needs a more
organic transition.
Paraman’s character should be explored further to add more layers to the story. Additionally,
there’s too much reliance on dialogue rather than action, which affects the storytelling’s
effectiveness.
Strengthening these elements will make the screenplay more engaging and emotionally
resonant.
